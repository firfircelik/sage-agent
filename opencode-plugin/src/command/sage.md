description: Process query with self-improving AI, RLM optimization, and long-term memory
agent: opencode
model: auto

Use sage-agent to process this query with self-improving capabilities:

{{query}}

Expected outcomes:
• RLM optimization applied (30-60% token reduction)
• Long-term memory recall for similar queries
• Learned patterns automatically applied
• Response validation for accuracy
• Quality improvement suggestions provided

The agent will:
1. Check if exact query was asked before (instant recall <1ms)
2. Recall similar past interactions for context
3. Apply advanced token optimization strategies
4. Validate response for hallucinations
5. Store interaction for future learning
6. Extract and learn patterns
